# phundamental [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skl/phundamental.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skl/phundamental)

phundamental is a collection of bash scripts designed to help ease the creation of lightweight
web servers. You're encouraged to delve into the various `install.sh` files and customise them
to suit your particular server(s) and personal preferences.

## Prerequisites

### Linux

You're already there.

### Mac

Install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

### Windows

1. Install [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
1. Install the following packages using Cygwin's `setup.exe`:
    1. `bzip2`
    1. `ca-certificates`
    1. `gawk`
    1. `gcc-g++`
    1. `git`
    1. `subversion`
    1. `tar`
    1. `wget`
1. Install `apt-cyg` as below:

```
svn --force export http://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ /bin/
chmod +x /bin/apt-cyg
```

There is currently an issue with apt-cyg preventing usage, you will need to apply the following fix to `/bin/apt-cyg`:

#### 32 bit

Line 68:

```
http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/cygwin/x86
```

Line 331:
```
install=`cat "release/$pkg/desc" | awk '/^install: / { print $2; exit }'|sed 's/\/x86//g'`
```

#### 64 bit

Line 68:

```
http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/cygwin/x86_64
```

Line 331:
```
install=`cat "release/$pkg/desc" | awk '/^install: / { print $2; exit }'|sed 's/\/x86_64//g'`
```

#### General

It is recommended that you add `/usr/local/bin` to the beginning of your path. Add the following
to your `.profile` or `.bashrc`:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

## Instructions

Clone the repo to a directory on your server:

    git clone https://github.com/skl/phundamental.git

**N.B.** If you're running cygwin or you don't have sudo installed, remove `sudo` from the below commands.

### Install all modules

Execute the top-level installer, it will ask you which modules to install:

    sudo phundamental/install

### Install some modules

Execute the top-level installer with parameters (one per module, order doesn't matter):

    sudo phundamental/install nodejs php nginx

### Install one module

There are two ways of doing this, as above:

    sudo phundamental/install php

Alternatively:

    sudo phundamental/modules/php/install

## Modules

phundamental is based on modules. The current out-of-the-box modules are as follows:

* **mariadb** - An open-source drop-in replacement for MySQL
* **nginx** - A fast and lightweight alternative to Apache
* **nodejs** - Server-side JavaScript. Recent versions include `npm`
* **php** - PHP with FPM if you choose to install v5.3.3+ (or any version now listed in `modules/php/fpm-patch-versions.conf`)

Each module is designed to allow for the installation of multiple concurrent versions. For example you could
run both PHP versions 5.3.20 and 5.4.10 and have nginx use a different version of PHP per virtual host.
Configuration examples are included in the modules and are installed at the same time as the binaries.

Source code and binaries will be downloaded and compiled at installation time. This allows phundamental to
stay small and portable. A full git clone currently weighs in at about 2 MiB (including all git ojects).

### Optional modules

* Oracle Instant Client [oic](https://github.com/skl/phundamental-oic)

If you'd like add the optional modules, execute the following in your phundamental
installation directory *prior* to executing the installer:

    git submodule update --init

You can update all submodules in future by executing:

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master

### Upcoming modules

* postfix (MariaDB backend) + roundcube client
